## Architecture

This project follows ribot's Android architecture guidelines that are based on [MVP (Model View Presenter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter). Read more about them [here](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/architecture_guidelines/android_architecture.md).

### How to implement a new screen following MVP

Imagine you have to implement a sign in screen. 

1. Create a new package under `ui` called `signin`
2. Create an new Activity called `ActivitySignIn`. You could also use a Fragment.
3. Define the view interface that your Activity is going to implement. Create a new interface called `SignInMvpView` that extends `MvpView`. Add the methods that you think will be necessary, e.g. `showSignInSuccessful()`
4. Create a `SignInPresenter` class that extends `BasePresenter<SignInMvpView>`
5. Implement the methods in `SignInPresenter` that your Activity requires to perform the necessary actions, e.g. `signIn(String email)`. Once the sign in action finishes you should call `getMvpView().showSignInSuccessful()`.
